## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Readiness Status
✅ **READY**

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action
*   **None.** All artifacts (PRD, Architecture, Epic, UX) are present, congruent, and high quality.

### Recommended Next Steps
1.  **Proceed to Sprint Planning:** The Epics are ready to be converted into a Sprint Plan.
2.  **Prototype "Chaos Layer":** During Sprint 0 or early implementation, validate that the visual distortion effects (UX Recommendation) do not compromise the 60fps NFR on mobile.
3.  **Strict Data Validation:** Ensure the build-time test for `rituals_v20.js` is implemented in Story 1.2 as specified to prevent runtime crashes.

### Final Note
This assessment identified **0 Critical Issues** and **1 Warning (UX Complexity)**. The project is well-scoped, the modular architecture is respected, and the requirements coverage is 100%. You are exceptionally well-prepared for implementation.
